Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Sum called ... 
returning from sum

would be logged first because we call sum2Darray which is on the main thread. As we pass correct array its computational operation is expensive
so it would be executed on eventLoop. 
Similarly Sum called ... 
would be executed after this as it is on the main thread. 

Then 
rejecting ... 
returning from sum
BAD INPUT: Expected array as input
would be logged as even if it is async operation it gets executed before the addition of matrix is performed. 

resolving ... 
45

Now, the async operation of addition is completed and the result is logged on to the console.
